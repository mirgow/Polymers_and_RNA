# Polymers_and_RNA

## Introduction

Hey all!
This is the project where I explore the compaction of branched polymers and translate those dynamics towards the study of fluctuations and folding of mitchondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA) molecules.

### Prerequisites

Instructions are below for downloading the softwares used in the project and working with the files in this repository. 

These assume a Windows OS, downloading and working with a Linux Subterminal (Personally worked through Windows Subsystem for Linux 2). Modify accordingly for Apple OS.  

Windows Workflow
1. Ensure Windows Powershell is installed. 
2. Ensure Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is installed. Preferably WSL2. 
3. Activate WSL2. 
```
wsl.exe
Sudo apt-get update
Sudo apt-get install curl
```
